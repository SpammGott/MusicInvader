How to: Add your own music

If you want to have even more fun with the Game, you can add your own music by adding your .mp3 Files to the res Folder. 

Location of the .jar File.
The .jar File must be in the same Folder as the res Folder, for a perfect MusicInvader experience.
You have to copy the res Folder yourself, because of the 100MB upload limit.
Start the .jar with Java -jar MusicInvader.jar, YOU HAVE TO NAVIGATE TO IT BEFOREHAND.
The Alternative is to just double click it.

Have fun,
